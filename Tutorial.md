### Section Two: The Interface  

1. From the menus at the top, click **Map**. This action opens the default map viewer and should look like this:  

    ![map interface](./Intro-to-AGOL-images/agol03.jpg)  
    
**NOTE: If the default viewer does not look like the above screenshot, you may have to click 'Open in new map viewer' at the top right.**

The New Map Viewer is composed of a dark toolbar on the left and a light toolbar on the right. Depending on the tool you have selected, various panels will appear.  

At the bottom of each toolbar there is a 'collapse/expand' button ![collapse_expand](./Intro-to-AGOL-images/agol04.jpg).  
2. Click these buttons to collapse or expand the menus.  
3. Click the 'hide/show interface' button ![hide interface](./Intro-to-AGOL-images/agol05.jpg) to collapse all menus and panels at once.
